Playing with the Game of Life
===

Let me start this post by saying that if you have been around the block, you will probably find this pretty mundane. That said, I want to go over a classic game/hack/algorithm that every generation rediscovers.

In 1970, mathematician [John Horton Conway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) devised a game that has become a rite of passage in hacker culture, [the Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). It is a deceptively simple cellular automaton, that allows complex designs to arise from simple seed patterns.

The beauty of this algorithm is in its simplicity. There are only a [few rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Rules):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

From this "creatures" will often emerge; the most well known being the glider.
