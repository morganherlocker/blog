turf + browserify
===

Turf has had a broken browser build for the past month or so. As of today, that is no longer the case. Now you can script geoprocessing tasks to your hearts content in the browser.

That being said, there is still plenty of room for improvement on the browser front. The main two issues are:


1. The current minified file weighs in at ~700kb. Workable but painful.

2. jsts is still pretty painful to debug when something goes wrong. Errors are unhandled, the code follows Java idioms, and it accounts for about 500kb of the total 700kb.

3. If you use turf, you have to download the entire thing.
