[Geocolor.io](http://geocolor.io/) is a web app that creates color themed choloropleth maps based on [geojson data](http://geojson.org/).

The maps can be saved to the desktop as geojson files or shared as [full screen maps](http://bl.ocks.org/anonymous/raw/a2ea4cd171b9560e9340/). The styles are based off of the [simplestyle-spec](https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec/tree/master/1.1.0), so the files will render with colors in many tools like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v1.6.2/) or [github](https://github.com/blog/1772-diffable-more-customizable-maps).

There are several ways to [classify data](https://github.com/morganherlocker/geocolor#classification), and custom styles can be added such as stroke width, fill opacity, or [maki markers](https://www.mapbox.com/maki/).

The code is fully [open source](https://github.com/morganherlocker/geocolor) under the MIT License. Along with the web app, geocolor is also a javascript module that can be used in node.js or in the browser to make your own custom apps or scripts.
