Hi, I am an open source hacker. My research focuses on distributed data processing tools -- mostly targeting maps, privacy, and telematics. I am the author of the <a href="http://turfjs.org/">Turf</a> geospatial analysis library, as well as a number of other low level geo algorithms used in mapping software today. By day, I work for <a href="http://sharedstreets.io/">SharedStreets</a>, a non-profit building an open reference system for sharing information about the infrastructure around us. In my spare time, I enjoy gardening and music.
