Hi, I am an open source hacker. My research focuses on distributed data processing tools -- mostly targeting maps, privacy, and telematics. I am the author of the <a href="http://turfjs.org/">Turf</a> geospatial analysis library, as well as a number of other low level geometry and statistics algorithm libraries commonly used by journalists, scientists, researchers, and cartographers. In my spare time, I enjoy gardening and music.
