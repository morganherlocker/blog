      <h1 id="visualizing-npm-modules-by-geography">Visualizing npm modules by Geography</h1>
<p><a href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a> is the node.js package manager. Coders from all over the world publish javascript packages through npm to distribute easy to consume modules, and it is <a href="http://modulecounts.com/">growing fast</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/substack">@substack</a> took up the task of <a href="https://gist.github.com/substack/7373338#file-cities">compiling npm modules by city using npm module authors cross referenced against listed github locations</a>, and the results were intriguing. </p>
<p>This data lacked geo references, and it was begging to be visualized, so I did some processing on the data. Here is the repo with the data in various stages:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/morganherlocker/geo-npm-contributions">https://github.com/morganherlocker/geo-npm-contributions</a></p>
<p>Here is the geojson of the final output:</p>

<p>And here is a shot of the US, themed using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization">natural breaks jenks classification</a> algorithm:</p>

<p>A few notes on the data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This was just for fun, so the data is far from perfect. To perform the geocoding, I simply did a join against the largest and most complete world city dataset I could find in the open data realm. I did some basic data formatting to get this to line up, but there all sorts of ways this could fail. Still, the results were decent on that front.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also, the data from substack only included the top 572 module authors, so if a town had more authors, but with less modules, that might skew the data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The images I provided show what the data looks like with some theming. Github map preview is awesome for the quick view, but if you really want to do some visualizations, I recommend opening up the data in a real GIS application like QGIS and applying some themes. I classified and normalized the data already, so this should be pretty simple.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jenks classification is a generous visualiztion for any city that is not San Francisco or Oakland. They clearly dominate, and if you <a href="https://raw.github.com/morganherlocker/geo-npm-contributions/master/quantiles.jpg">use a classification methodolgy like quantiles</a> or equal intervals, they light up while every other city fades out of the visualization for the most part. I chose jenks because, SV is clearly and outlier and I wanted to show a distribution that emphasized the spread of the community. Perhaps this is a bit disingenuous, but hey, that&#39;s statistics for you. :)</p>
</li>
<li><p>It would be very interesting to see a visualization of this data weighted against population to get a &quot;modules per capita&quot; score of some sort. I may do this, but if anyone is interested, have at it!</p>
</li>
<li><p>If we could get some sort of dependency graph across npm and do a rough join on this data, we could visualize dependencies across geography with weighted desire lines. That could be extremely interesting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
