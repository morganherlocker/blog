Ship Logs
---

This is a map of locations extracted from digitized ships logs from 1750 to 1850. The database was compiled by a number of researchers and is [was made available](https://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/cliwoc/) as a resource for studying historical climate change.

It is a fairly unique dataset in both breadth and depth; covering 100 years of pre-industrial data, and containing often amusing notes recorded by sailors. The data contains numerous fields for various meterological measurments, and [one researcher was able to extract all mentions of naval battles](https://www.kaggle.com/domcastro/climate-data-from-ocean-ships/wars-and-fights-draft/discussion), including a tussle with "a sea-monster of indeterminable size".

I have not done anything especially useful with the database yet, but I wanted to share this map of the full dataset and encourage anyone interested in climate science or maritime history to give it a look. The map was made using [tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe) and [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#darwin).
